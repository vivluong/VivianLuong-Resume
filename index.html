        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Vivian Luong and I am a first-year studying business administration at the University of California, Riverside.

Growing up in the Bay Area, I've always noticed the outreach of Silicon Valley Tech companies to local marginalized communities. Despite the diverse differences between these two, I was heart-warmed by the resources provided to help these underrepresented communities. This led to my curiosity of utilizing business analyst strategies to streamline operations solutions in not only communities, but companies as well. 

In the past I have held the position of Lieutenant Governor for a community service organization called Key Club. I coordinated 24 educational self-development workshops with professional speakers and non-profit organizations for students and raised $2,000+ for the Pediatric Trauma Program from a self-designed product. I also became the Vice President of my class within a professional business fraternity - Delta Sigma Pi. As Vice President, I contacted local businesses and organizations regarding fundraisers, community service, and professional development events. Additionally, I am currently the Assistant Director of External Relations for UCR’s Student Alumni Association. I assemble and present the budget sheet, event proposal, and event marketing plan to UCR’s ASPB Board to advocate for a $1,000 grant, and collaborate with Director of Philanthropy to plan, coordinate, and execute quarterly on and off-campus community service events. 

In the 2019 local elections, I worked as a Poll Worker for Alameda County. Validating 5,000 voters’ registrations to determine eligibility to vote, guided voters on how to update street index and re-register and utilizing bilingual skills to greet voters, address inquiries and concerns, and assist with directions to the proper voting locations opened my eyes to my community. During the 2020 Presidential Elections Campaign, I worked for Grindstone Communications under Mike Bloomberg’s campaign. I consistently corresponded with voters through Hustle threads, achieving 1000 texts weekly, promoted new initiatives and events and surveyed 60 households weekly to provide accurate information about the campaign to answer questions and resolve complaints. I also juggled being a full-time student with being a boba barista, eventually being promoted to lead shift. At my part-time job, I modified the menu to create new drinks for owners and manager, oversaw creation of new menu layout, raising revenue by 5% and compiled nightly cash sales, maintained orderly and accurate cash register, verified store security, and guided nightly procedures.

I am proficient in the usage of graphic design with Adobe Ilustrator, Photoshop, and Canva. I am also conversationally competent in Cantonese, and experienced in the Microsoft Suite and Google Applications.

My goal is to one day play a positive difference in these communities to drive results. What I'm looking for next is an opportunity to become more involved, explore, and expand my analyst knowledge.
